			With four stories spread across more than 170,000 square feet, the Jerry Falwell Library has the latest technological advances, including a two-story robotic book retrieval system and a fully equipped technology commons. Featuring Jeffersonian-style architecture, the building offers a breathtaking view of the Blue Ridge Mountains and a newly created lake. Casual seating areas, reading rooms, a spacious caf√©, and multiple balconies and terraces also add to the relaxed, scholarly atmosphere.
