# Routing-Assistant-Application
This application guides the user through the Liberty University Library. The user first selects an initial and a final destination. Then, a map displaying the route as well as waypoints (importnat landmarks through the route) appears along with instructions to get to the desired place. In addition a blinking point appears in the screen in the place the user is supposed to be along with a picture of each waypoint to help the user. Finally the user can zoom in or zoom out the map in order to better see the route.

In addition the main menu provides the user with a tutorial and general information about the library.

This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJs (to store the waypoints), AngularJs (controllers), and JQuery.
